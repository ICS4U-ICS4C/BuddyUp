At beginning users will consent to a privacy form, stating that users acknowledge that their calendar data(subjects) will be used to find people who are studying same stuff
If they do not agree then it will not try and find people who have same subjects

Once user has found person, user asks the other person if they would like to be in a group
If person says yes then, they click on add icon then they both are added in a group
From there in the group chat page, they can discuss about questions and or find a suitable location for both of them using buddyUp button
  BuddyUp button - What finds and suggests in theory a suitable location
From there if they dont like it then they can either continue discussing on the channel
Or they can all find a better location that works for all of them
